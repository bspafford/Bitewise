# Food App

This is my food tracking app. It has many features including searching, barcode scanning, weight input, and more. Its purpose is to track calories and macros for the day, while keeping track of the user's weight.
I wanted to make this app because there are a lot of food apps that block many useful features behind a paywall. One of the most popular apps, myFitnessPal, requires a pricy monthly fee to use the barcode scanning feature. I wanted an app that didnâ€™t require the user to pay for such a simple feature.
